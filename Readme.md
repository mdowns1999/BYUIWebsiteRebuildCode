# BYUI Home Page Rebuild Overview

Welcome to my BYUI site rebuild! The purpose of this project was to build the site as close to the actual BYUi website as possible.  This was done with a few minor exceptions.  One, the Header used was the header found on the mobile version of the site. Two, part of the footer from the original homepage was excluded because it was not too important to the overall site.  The goal with the rest of the site though, was to use SCSS/CSS to get as close to the actual thing.  This means I tried paying attention to different details.  Now I did make minor adjustments based on what I thought could look better for the site.  Most of the site though will look close to the original.

# Development Environment 

The environment I used for this project was Visual Studio Code by Microsoft.  The Web Page was deployed on GitHub.  This project used HTML, CSS, SASS, and Javascript.  If you mess around with the CSS, make sure to run the Sass compiler and edit in the SASS files.
