# BYUI Home Page Rebuild Overview

Welcome to my BYUI site rebuild! The purpose of this project was to build the site as close to the acutal BYUi website as possible.  THis was done with a few minor exceptions.  One, the Header used was the header found on th emoblile version of th esite. Two, part of the footer from th eorginal homepage was exculded becuase it was not too important to the overall site.  The goal with the rest of the site though, was to use SCSS/CSS to get as close to the actual thing.  THis means I tried paying attention to different details.  Now I did make minor adjustsments based on what I thought could look better for the site.  Most of the site though will look close to the original.

# Development Environment

The enviroment I used for this project was Visual Studio Code by Mircorsoft.  The Web Page was deployed on GitHub.  This project used HTML, CSS, SASS, and Javascript.  If you messa round with the CSS, make sure to run the sass complier and edit in the SASS files.
